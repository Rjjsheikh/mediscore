# **Medi Score Calculator Report**

## **1. Introduction**  
The document presents an extensive description of the Medi Score Calculator including its engineering strategy alongside technical choices and development implementation methods. The Medi Score functions as an effortless rule-based assessment solution which determines illness intensity through medical observation results. 
A scalable and efficient solution was created to deliver straightforward use for healthcare workers alongside robust performance and precise accuracy. The system follows object-oriented programming (OOP) with structured error-handling among other features to deliver these objectives.




## **2. Development Approach**  
A structured engineering approach allowed the development of the program for efficiency and maintainability purposes. The key steps include:  

### **2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Approach**  
- **Encapsulation**: All patient-specific data together with calculations have been contained within the MediScoreCalculator class..  
- **Modularity**: Through its usage of a class structure the code maintains flexibility and so any modifications won't alter other program sections.  
- **Reusability**: The program design treats patients independently as objects which permits processing numerous patients through a scalable framework.  

### **2.2 Input Validation and Error Handling**  
To ensure **data integrity and robustness**, the `validate_input` function was implemented to:  
- **Restrict input ranges** (e.g., SpO₂ cannot exceed **100%**).  
- **Handle invalid data types** (ensuring numerical inputs for respiration rate, temperature, etc.).  
- **Provide clear error messages** when incorrect inputs are detected.  

### **2.3 Scoring Logic Implementation**  
The scoring system follows a **well-structured conditional hierarchy** to ensure accurate assessment. Key principles include:  
- **Using an efficient if-else structure** to evaluate each parameter.  
- **Minimizing redundant checks** for optimized performance.  
- **Computing the final score in a single pass** to reduce computational overhead.  

### **2.4 Engineering Strategy & Implementation**  
The Medi Score Calculator was developed using a systematic and disciplined engineering methodology, guaranteeing that the final product was precise, effective, and scalable. A specific class, MediScoreCalculator, was developed to encapsulate patient data and scoring logic, encouraging modularity and reusability. The solution was constructed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. By avoiding incorrect entries and guaranteeing the accuracy of the data gathered, a strong input validation system was put in place to improve user engagement using the validate_input function. In order to ensure that each parameter was evaluated with the least amount of computing cost and with accuracy and clarity, the scoring logic was meticulously organized using hierarchical conditional statements. Edge situations, such as making sure SpO₂ levels did not surpass 100% and accurately distinguishing oxygen dependency in the final score computation, were also carefully handled. Clear variable names, organized output formatting, and a methodical control flow were used to further improve the program for readability and maintainability, guaranteeing that any future additions or alterations could be easily included. Error handling was included to improve robustness by preventing software crashes and provide user-friendly instructions. The output, which included the Medi Score and thorough descriptions of the underlying elements, was organized for clinical interpretation. A strong engineering mentality guided the whole development process, striking a balance between accuracy, usability, and performance to make the solution workable for actual healthcare applications.



## **3. Conclusion**  
Medi Score Calculator is designed as a strong, reliable, and scalable tool to evaluate patient cases in terms of predefined medical criteria. Using object-oriented programming, sound input validation, and optimized scoring algorithms, the program assures real-time reliable and accurate calculations while remaining user-friendly for healthcare professionals. It is made quite efficient, with a reduction of computational load through logical organization of conditionals and elimination of redundant checks. Further, special attention has been given over and above the standard error handling and user interaction, making sure that invalid inputs do not bother the running of the program. The design is hugely scalable so that a new physiological parameter can easily be added, or its scoring criterion can be adjusted with shifts in the changing medical parameters. Overall, this project is an excellent engineering approach, blending precision, usability, and performance to walk the visionary talk of a dramatic tool for clinical decision-making.
