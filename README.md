# **Medi Score Calculator Report**

## **1. Introduction**  
This document provides a detailed explanation of the **Medi Score Calculator**, covering its **engineering strategy, technical choices, and development approach**. The **Medi Score** is a **rule-based assessment system** that evaluates the severity of a patient’s condition based on **medical observations**.  

A **scalable and efficient** solution was implemented to ensure **accuracy and usability** for healthcare professionals. The system follows **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, incorporating **structured error handling** and **robust validation techniques**.

## **2. Development Approach**  
A **structured engineering approach** was followed to ensure **efficiency and maintainability**. The key components include:  

### **2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Approach**  
- **Encapsulation**: All **patient-specific data** and calculations are contained within the `MediScoreCalculator` class.  
- **Modularity**: A **class-based structure** ensures modifications **won't disrupt** other program sections.  
- **Reusability**: Each patient is treated as an **independent object**, enabling **scalable processing**.  

### **2.2 Input Validation and Error Handling**  
To ensure **data integrity and robustness**, the `validate_input` function was implemented to:  
- **Restrict input ranges** (e.g., SpO₂ cannot exceed **100%**).  
- **Handle invalid data types** (ensuring numerical inputs for respiration rate, temperature, etc.).  
- **Provide clear error messages** when incorrect inputs are detected.  

### **2.3 Scoring Logic Implementation**  
The scoring system follows a **well-structured conditional hierarchy** to ensure accurate assessment. Key principles include:  
- **Using an efficient if-else structure** to evaluate each parameter.  
- **Minimizing redundant checks** for optimized performance.  
- **Computing the final score in a single pass** to reduce computational overhead.  

### **2.4 Engineering Strategy & Implementation**  
The **Medi Score Calculator** was developed using a **disciplined engineering approach** to ensure **precision, efficiency, and scalability**.  

- The `MediScoreCalculator` class was designed to **encapsulate patient data and scoring logic** for easy **modularity and reusability**.  
- **OOP principles** ensure a **scalable and maintainable** architecture.  
- A **robust input validation system** (`validate_input`) prevents incorrect entries and enhances user interaction.  
- **Hierarchical conditional statements** ensure that each parameter is **evaluated efficiently** with **minimal computational cost**.  
- **Edge cases** were carefully managed, including handling **SpO₂ limits (≤100%)** and **oxygen dependency adjustments**.  
- **Descriptive variable names**, **structured output formatting**, and **methodical control flow** improve **readability and maintainability**.  
- **Error handling** prevents crashes and **provides user-friendly guidance** when issues occur.  
- The **output format** presents the **Medi Score and detailed parameter descriptions**, making clinical interpretation easier.  

The **entire development process** was guided by a **strong engineering mindset**, balancing **accuracy, usability, and performance** to ensure real-world applicability in healthcare settings.
