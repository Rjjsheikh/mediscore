Introduction

This project is a solution for calculating the Medi Score, a simple rule-based scoring system used to assess the severity of a patientâ€™s condition. The goal is to implement a robust, maintainable, and scalable solution while demonstrating best coding practices and problem-solving skills.

Thought Process & Problem-Solving Approach

1. Understanding the Problem

Analyzed the problem statement to extract key components and constraints.

Identified the parameters required for scoring: Air/Oxygen usage, Consciousness, Respiration Rate, SpO2, and Temperature.

Defined a structured approach to map inputs to scores based on predefined rules.

2. Planning the Solution

Break Down the Logic: Segmented the scoring system into separate components.

Edge Case Handling: Considered potential invalid inputs, rounding rules, and numerical range validation.

Code Maintainability: Ensured modularity, clear documentation, and structured output formatting.

3. Implementation Strategy

Define a Function: Implemented a function to compute the Medi Score based on provided patient data.

Conditional Logic for Scoring: Used well-structured if-elif-else conditions to determine scores.

Formatted Output: Displayed the score breakdown in a structured tabular format for readability.

Error Handling: Implemented validation to ensure input correctness.

4. Testing and Refinement

Manual Testing: Checked various inputs to verify expected scores.

Code Readability: Used meaningful variable names and structured comments.

Future-Proofing: Designed the function to be adaptable for future modifications or integrations.

Code Highlights & Best Practices

Modular and Readable: Clear separation of logic for different parameters.

Scalability: The function can be extended to accommodate new parameters or changes.

Production-Ready Design: Well-documented and structured output for clarity.

Performance Considerations: Efficient conditional checks to avoid unnecessary computations.

Future Enhancements

Automated Testing: Implement unit tests to verify correctness across multiple test cases.

Logging Mechanism: Implement logging for debugging and tracking patient score trends.

Summary

This project demonstrates a strong engineering mindset by emphasizing structured problem-solving, maintainability, and scalability. The solution is designed to be clear, efficient, and adaptable, making it an ideal implementation for a junior developer assessment.
